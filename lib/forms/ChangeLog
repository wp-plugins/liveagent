version 1.2 (September 04, 2008)

    -   a new feature has been added: automatic output generation. if your form does not
        need any special output format, you can simply call the render() method without
        specifying a template name to let the script handle it, thus saving you some time
        as you are not needed to also code the form's layout.
    -   a new type of controls has been added: "html". with this you can insert arbitrary
        HTML code into your forms. This is usefull when you don't use templates but
        rather let the script generate your forms and you need to have some extra HTML in
        your forms (notes, descriptions, etc) - because letting the script to automatically
        generate your forms means that you don't have a template to insert your HTML code
        into
    -   arrays of custom rules can now be set for controls; up until now, only one custom
        rule per control could be set
    -   generated forms are now (more) W3C compliant
    -   CAPTCHA is now case insensitive
    -   default template is now nicer
    -   better error reporting
    -   fixed a few minor bugs
    -   many documentation refinements

version 1.1.1 (March 16, 2008)

    -   rewritten css for the default template
    -   fixed a bug where submitting array-like controls (multiple checkboxes with sharing
        the same name or a "select" control with "multiple" set) would crash the script
    -   fixed a bug where submitting text fields with empty spaces would pass the validation
        for "required" fields
    -   fixed a bug where the captcha image was not updated upon submission
    -   upon submission, all characters were transformed to their applicable html entities,
        which could cause a lot of headaches if you were submitting text in  other language
        than english

version 1.1 (November 30, 2007)

    -   added *heavy* XSS (cross site scripting) injection prevention (the class used for
        filtering for XSS injection is the Input class from the Code Igniter PHP framework
        and it's used with permission)
    -   previously some accented characters got scrambled upon submission as htmlentities()
        was being called without the UTF-8 argument
    -   fixed an error where, when having multiple forms on a page, all forms were processed
        upon submission

version 1.0 (June 02, 2007)

    -   trying to change the main template of the class had no effects
    -   the class was not working correctly in PHP 4.x.x
    -   fixed an error where using a nonnumeric index for the first element in a "select"
        control (indicating the "nothing selected" condition of the control) would lead to
        a crash
    -   added validation rule for a list of comma separated email addresses
    -   many people have asked for it so i've added an example on how to use the radio
        controls, the checkbox controls and on how to do quick custom validations
    -   multiple instances of the form could not be created on the same page
    -   error messages can now be customized from the main template (the one in the
        /templates folder) - thanks to Claude Quezel for suggesting this one
    -   custom blocks can now be parsed in the form's template by using the newly added
        "parseBlock" method
    -   the "addOptions" method of the "select" control was overwriting any previously set
        options. now subsequent calls to this method will append options to the existing ones
    -   custom form actions can now be specified - previously, forms were always submitted
        to themselves
    -   a new property was added: "locked". by default, when a form is reloaded after a
        submission, all the controls will have their respective submitted value, while the
        default value set by user will be ignored. setting this property to TRUE, will make
        the controls preserve their user-provided default values, ignoring the submitted value
    -   previously, only variables could be passed to the addVar method. now strings and
        constant can also be passed
    -   multiple options can now be preselected for select controls having the "multiple"
        attribute set (read the documentation for the constructor of select controls)
    -   in order to make the generated output valid XHTML 1.0, the label controls no longer
        have the "name" attribute and the form has now the "action" attribute set; also
        the "selected" attribute is now correctly set for "select" controls (thanks to
        Claude Quezel)
    -   made some changes in the main template's CSS file, provided by Claude Quezel, that
        makes the fieldsets look in the same way in Firefox and Opera as in IE - thanks!
    -   on some PHP installations file upload was not working (enctype and max_file_size
        were not being set)

version 1.0 BETA 3 (February 16, 2007)

    -   for the 'select' control, if options were specified having literal keys
        and the 'mandatory' rule was set, the control would never pass validation
        (thanks to sridhar for reporting)
    -   a major security issue was fixed where an attacker could inject arbitrary HTML
        and/or JavaScript code along with the submitted data. now all the submitted data
        is passed through the htmlentities() function and, if magic_quotes are on, are
        stripslashed (thanks to Bartosz for reporting this one)
    -   file uploads were not working because neither "enctype" nor MAX_FILE_SIZE were set 
        upon the rendering of the form
    -   if you would set a checkbox's state as "checked" by default, any subsequent submits
        would set the checkbox's value to "checked" even if user would uncheck it
        (thanks to sridhar for reporting)
    -   "mandatory" rule could not be set to the "file" control
        (thanks to sridhar for reporting)
    -   a new method was added: "addVar()". through this method, user defined variables can be
        made accessible from within the form's template file.
    -   added a new control: "captcha" which generates CAPTCHA images
    -   password controls no longer redisplay the entered value
    
version 1.0 BETA 2 (January 03, 2007)

    -   in Firefox, trying to open the date picker would produce a JavaScript error
    -   the icon for opening the date picker was not visible in Firefox

version 1.0 BETA (December 19, 2006)

    -   initial release
